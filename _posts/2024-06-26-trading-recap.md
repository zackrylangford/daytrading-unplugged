### Overview
Kind of hard to write this recap TBH. Took a really bad loss today. Tried to trade gold overnight and made a bunch of mistakes. First, I placed orders on the wrong ticker, which is what the first loss was, so not great. I then placed the trade on the correct ticker and set my stops and limit orders to take profit. The trade went against me. This is when it got really bad. I then reversed positions, which was fine because it went with me, however I then made the mistake of doubling my position instead of setting my profit target order which then flustered me. I closed out of half of my position, which I would have held onto and eventually it would have worked but since I doubled down I was a bit stuck. This looked OK until a big squeeze happened that squeezed me out. I then went long out of anger and got stopped out again. The last few trades were just me trying to trigger the 1000 loss target out of spite. Not good. Still trying to deal with what happened.

I think the first thing is that I should not be trying to trade overnight. I have had some success with it before but it is too much stress, so I need to avoid it. The second thing is that I need to not allow myself to get impatient. I was only $313 away from completing the combine and now I am $1313 away just like that, giving up all of my gains from June. I let the pressure and desire to get across the finish line change how I traded. 

I can't say that I am actually learning from this, because these are mistakes I thought that I had curbed in the past, but they reared their ugly head again.
