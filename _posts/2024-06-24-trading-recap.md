### Overview
Definitely did not do a good job being patient but was able to make it out with a positive day. I am taking slightly larger positions as I am trying to scale up to the point where I can reach the $200/day winning target that TopStep has set. For this combine though, all I have to do is reach the $3,000 total profits, so I am just being patient and content with making small gains towards this goal. I know that simply making these small gains will get me to the goal of being a funded trader. As tough as it is to only make small gains, I know that all I need to do is scale up and I will be able to make more over time. 

Note: If I would have waited to take my first trade in the morning I would have not taken a full stop loss and I would be up almost $300 for the day, so that is a good lesson for me. Every time I try to jump the gun on a trade I put myself in risk of this. I need to be a little more patient and wait.
