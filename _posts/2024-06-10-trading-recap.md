### Overview
Just a really tough day of trading. The setups were fine, it was all about the mental battles for me. Was able to come away with a slight green day, but it was an up and down day. I had a couple of inadvertant trades happen though, so if you take those away I would have been much higher. Just need to make sure that I am alert and paying attention to details. For instance, the 3 contract trade on GC was meant for MGC so I immediately closed that out for a tough loss. I think if I get rid of that trade I am way greener for the day. I also left an order out on the MNQ which resulted in a loss of 50. I didn't realize I had left my stop loss out, even though I had already closed out the trade. The stop loss got triggered and so I ended up in a position and had no ideaa. I did not handle my emotions at all, as both of these got me flustered and on edge. Was really fortunate to have found some solid trades to make up for it and close out of the day in the green.
