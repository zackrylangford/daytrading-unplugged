### Overview
Tried a different strategy today. Went for a lower win rate but larger wins. It was way too emotional for me while I was trying to trade. I felt like this was way too much over trading. I reversed positions in order to take small losses and set myself up to catch the big trend but it just ate me up. I managed to find a couple of nice runners but this was not my best effort. I was way too stressed out and it felt like I was just in the wild west. I don't like this style, but I'm trying to figure it out. There were so many trades taken that I don't have room for the charts. Lots of attempts to short overbought tickers. My good trades were GC (Gold) long and then ES (S&P) short. Will evaluate this and consider it as a strategy, but I don't know at this point.
