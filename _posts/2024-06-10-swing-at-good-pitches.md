Patience is crucial in both baseball and day trading. I remind myself daily to "wait for good pitches to hit."

In baseball, a key to successful hitting is anticipating and visualizing the pitch before it’s thrown. Reacting to a fastball is incredibly difficult, so you need to look for it in your comfort zone. Then, it’s simply a matter of stopping your swing if the pitch isn't right. This approach lets you focus on a good swing and making solid contact.

While there are many strategies in hitting, especially at higher levels, the most successful hitters focus on swinging at pitches they are most likely to hit well.

The same principle applies to day trading. You need a plan and the discipline to swing at good pitches. YOLOing everything will lead to strikeouts.

Remember, patience and strategy are key. Swing at good pitches, both in baseball and trading.
