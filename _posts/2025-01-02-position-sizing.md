One key lesson I've learned is that if I'm feeling anxious about a trade, it might be because my position size is too large. If I can't comfortably accept the potential loss before entering a trade, then my position is likely too big. 

Yes, smaller position sizes might mean smaller gains, but it's better to manage a small position that you can let run than to cut a large position too quickly due to fear. With a well-managed small position, you can still make a good profit if the trade goes your way. It's one of my biggest struggles because I want to be able to make large (and quick!) gains, and I rarely let myself really consider the possibility of it going against me and how I would feel after a loss.

The larger the position, the quicker you need to cut losses or take gains, especially with the volatility of futures tickers. This can often result in getting stopped out prematurely. Remember, it's not just about maximizing gains; it's also about managing emotions and staying in control.

Trading is as much about psychology as it is about strategy. When anxiety takes over, it clouds judgment and leads to impulsive decisions. By reducing your position size, you give yourself the mental space to think clearly and stick to your plan. Itâ€™s about finding a balance where you can remain calm and composed, allowing your trades to develop without undue stress.

It's important to recognize that every trader has a different risk tolerance. What feels like a small position to one trader might feel enormous to another. Continuously evaluate your comfort level and adjust accordingly. This self-awareness will not only protect your capital but also enhance your trading performance over time.

In summary, taking smaller positions helps manage anxiety, reduces the risk of premature exits, and allows for clearer decision-making. It's a practical step towards achieving long-term success in trading.
