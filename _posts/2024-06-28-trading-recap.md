### Overview
Today I returned after the big disappointments of the previous two days to attempt to rebuild my account and get back to passing this combine. I feel more loose and less stressed about losing, which is good, but I know that the pressure mounts the closer that you get to passing. 

I realized that one of my biggest problems is that I have been so fearful of losing that I haven't been able to sit with any of my trades that well. I also have been trying to trade times in the market which are difficult to trade. 

I decided that I was going to take a good sized position and not worry so much about the dollar amount, and focus on the risk vs. return in terms of the actual price of the ticker itself. This is what I have learned from mentors and books. If you focus on the PNL you will struggle, so focus more on making good risk vs. reward trades and execute. 

I also decided to look for trades during major sessions throughout the day and evening. So, Asia, London, US market times. I noticed that Gold tends to move very well around 10-11pm and is easier to find entries and exits. Also, the pre-market sessions of the US markets are much easier to see moves in versus the actual market times (9:30A-4:00p). I tend to be so much more stressed during those times because there are often more "tug of war" times. 

So, Friday was a good day back and pretty close to how I would like to trade going forward. Good sizing. I used my indicators well and I looked for entries around the key support/resistance and based my analyisis on Volume and Price Action, along with Camarilla Pivot Points.
