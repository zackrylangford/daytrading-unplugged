### Overview
Lots of news coming out today. We had CPI data before the open and FOMC in the afternoon. I waited until well after the CPI data was out to take a position. I took a very small position on MES of short 2 contracts. It looked like the R6/Breakout target was not going to hold after a huge pop upwards after the news. I could sense that it was a good opportunity to go short, but after I went short buyers came in a drove it back up to new all time highs. Luckily, because of my small position size I was able to hold through the push and wait for it to come back down. 

It definitely paused and pulled back for a bit, but it looked like the 5440 level was pretty good support so I was a bit worried. I ended up holding it throughout the FOMC announcements, which was not my plan but I made peace with getting stopped out at a new ATH. Fortunately, there was a nice spike of selling volume which allowed me to cover for a small gain. Better small gain than big loss. 

After I closed out it hesitated a bit before heading to new ATHs and then selling off really hard during the last hour of trading.
