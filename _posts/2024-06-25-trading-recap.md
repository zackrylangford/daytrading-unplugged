### Overview
Can't say that today was a good day, even though I ended with a positive day. I let the morning get away from me as I overtraded and took too large of a position size after I ended up being down. Just got really frustrated with how things were going and I just let myself get out of control. One of those days that could have ended a lot worse than it did. I know I need to figure out how to deal with this or I am not going to make it to the goal of becoming a profitable trader. Really tough to deal with it and to control my emotions. It's like I can't live with a red day, even though I know that it is very likely that red days will happen. Need to be more patient and need to continually remember to abide by my stop losses and max loss for the day.
