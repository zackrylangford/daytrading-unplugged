### Overview
I guess the reality is that it is not possible to become a trader without facing your emotions and trying to deal with them. 

I ended up giving into my frustrations and tried to just wing it with one trade. Never should have entered that trade and should have simply taken the day off and come back on Friday. It didn't blow up my account and cause me to be done but it put me back to where I am about $2200 away from passing the combine, which is crazy because I was only $300 away from passing only 48 hours before this trade. Two days completely set me back. 

I am realizing more and more how deeply challenging trading really is. It forces you to confront your demons and your emotions more than anything else I have done in my entire life. It is so easy to completely go off the rails and lose it. You have to deal with fear, envy, greed, doubt, anger, hope, and more in order to become a good trader. Part of me doesn't know if I believe that it is possible for anyone to actually master the markets and do this for a living. There seems to be plenty of people who do, at least according to the marketing that is all over the place. 

Either way, I locked out after this one trade and took some time to think and rethink.
