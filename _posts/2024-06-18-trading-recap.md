### Overview
Very choppy trading on the indices today. Was able to take oil short for a really small gain but overall it was a very challenging day to trade. Kept getting stopped out on choppiness. Looks like it is going to sell off as there is a lot of activity and we are at the ATH. The indices are due for a pull back so we will see. I just kept my risk low and was very quick in locking out profits for the day. Small victories, but I am living to trade again tomorrow. Even though it is not as much profit as I would like, it gives me a little more cushion to continue trading and figuring out a better strategy.
