### Overview

Took my first trade on MGC (Micro Gold) as volume came in around R3. Looked like it was struggling at this level so I went short with a stop above R3. Was able to get a decent entry but buyers came in and pushed it above R3. I moved my stop up as it looked pretty clear that it was going to grind higher. 

Took my second trade on MNQ (Micro Nasdaq). I hate trading this thing and I don't want to anymore. My trade looks really good, then really bad, then really good, and back and forth. Shorted at R4 when it was facing a lot of selling pressure, but it popped up and wicked me out.

Final trade was back in MGC (Micro Gold) as it was facing more selling pressure down passed R3. It was struggling and looked like we were headed lower, but got stopped out on a squeeze. 

After the last loss I clicked on the manual lockout button quickly and closed everything out. At the moment I am really frustrated and wish I would still have a chance to make up for the losses, but I know that the right move is to walk away and come back tomorrow. Such a frustrating day. It's days like this that make you feel like your strategy is not going to work at all. Even though the levels seemed pretty accurate, you would think that at least one of those trades would have worked out better. However, with the overall market bullish today, that may have been the biggest challenge in going short. Everything is popping higher today so I think that is a lesson. It takes time for a momentum to change. Perhaps I need to pay more attention to daily chart and be more patient. I imagine later in the day could be more primed for selling. 


**Total P/L**: -$388.76


### Trade 1: MCG (Micro GOLD)

</a>
- **Position**: Short (4 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2355.90 (Slightly below R3)
- **Original Stop**: 2360.50 (Break of long wicked high)
- **Adjusted Stop**: 2359.50 (Brought my stop down to limit loss)
- **Exit 1**: 2359.50 (Covered 4, stop loss triggered)


- **Result**: -$148.16

**Notes**: As tough as it is to take a loss, looking back at the one minute it wasn't a terrible trade. I think I need to still be a bit more patient and really analyze the volume maybe, but it really looked like it was struggling and I got a pretty good entry. I did a limit sell order and waited to get filled, which helped me limit risk and take a slightly larger position. It could have easily sold off and would have been a green trade, but buyers came in and pushed it up. Looks like an overall bullish day so it might not be a good day to short. Also, I should probably pay more attention to the timing of my trades. This was earlier in the morning when volume is not as predictable, so that could have played into what I was seeing. 



### Trade 1: MNQ (Micro Nasdaq)

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/trading-recaps/2024-06-05trade2.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Screenshot 1" class="img-responsive">
</a>
- **Position**: Short (2 contracts)
- **Entry**: 18,827.75 (Slightly below R4)
- **Original Stop**: 18,857.50 (Break of HOD)
- **Exit 1**: 18,857.50 (Covered 2, stop loss triggered)


- **Result**: -$119.48

**Notes**: Again, this wasn't a terrible trade attempt. From the charts it looks like a decent place to go short. I think the challenge is that this is the selling climax zone potentially, and I should have waited a bit longer before going short. Looks like it is continuing to go nuts up and down with lots of selling and buying and long wicks. Not a good time to take an entry again. This happened on both my trades so far this morning. Will look to be more patient coming up. If my next trade is a loser I will have to close out for the day. 




### Trade 1: MGC (Micro Gold)

  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/trading-recaps/2024-06-05trade3.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Screenshot 1" class="img-responsive">
</a>

- **Position**: Short (3 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2,356.60 (After loss of R3 and continued selling volume)
- **Original Stop**: 2,360.50 (Break of Recent Highs)
- **Exit 1**: 2,360.50 (Covered 3, stop loss triggered)


- **Result**: -$120.12

**Notes**: Again, just didn't go my way. I traded the strategy and it looked REALLY good for a but. It hovered around R3 and then selling volume came in down to R2. Should have potentially covered some at R2, which would have limited the loss, but it was shaping up really nice. Should have at least brought SL to breakeven as well. Buyers came in and squeezed me out. I think this was another logical trade that just missed. The one thing going in my mind is that it is a bullish overall day, so it is tough to short into that momentum. 

**Total P/L**: -$388.76
