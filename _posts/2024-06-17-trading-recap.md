### Overview
Not a great day for me, but managed to only take a small loss. Was a bit overanxious as I am getting to the final stretch on my combine to get funded. Also, I went golfing this morning so I was trading a different time than usual. The indices were making new highs all day today so I took ES long for a small gain initially. I then attempted to trade gold to varying degrees of success. I think most of the big moves were done by the time I traded. Towards the end of the session I attempted to go short on ES and kept getting stopped out. It looked very toppy but managed to continue pushing higher towards a new high at the end of the day. I swapped positions and went long towards the high for a small win. 

My risk/return does not look good at all but it was mainly due to being stopped out with small gains as the trade started to turn. I felt like it was better to take really small gains and get stopped out with a chance for bigger gains if it continued my way. Was being a bit overcatious.
