### Overview
Another day of grinding out trades. I am continuing to adapt my strategy and honing in on better opportunities. I entered too early on a couple of losing trades, but in general I had a decent day. I am finding the micros to be much easier to manage right now while I find my footing. 

Also, was able to learn a bit more about volume profile and POC (point of control). This was pretty crucial in ES as the price really hovered around that area. 


### Trade Data

<div id="trade-table-placeholder">Loading trade data...</div>

<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    const tradeDate = "2024-06-11";  // Replace with the date of the trades you want to display
    const apiEndpoint = "https://x6vqzeow7a.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/get-trade-recaps";
    fetchTradeData(tradeDate, 'trade-table-placeholder', apiEndpoint);
  });
</script>
