## Trading Recap - Monday, June 3, 2024

### Overview

Took three trades today. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Total P/L**: +$410.34


### Trade 1: MCL (Micro Oil)
- **Position**: Long (5 contracts)
- **Entry**: 76.70 (Above S3)
- **Original Stop**: 76.34
- **Exit 1**: 76.99 (Sold 3)
- **Exit 2**: 77.33 (Sold 1)
- **Exit 3**: 77.33 (Sold 1)


- **Result**: (+$207)

**Notes**: Noticed it holding S3 pretty well. First time trading oil, went with micro and smaller position for first attempt. Got a nice pop up to S1 and was able to take partials on the way up. Held onto 1 lot to see if we would continue, but got stopped out back at S1. It eventually sold back off down to S3 overnight.

### Trade 2: MNQ (Micro Nasdaq)
- **Position**: Short (2 contracts)
- **Entry**: 18,681.50 (After loss of R3)
- **Original Stop**: 18706.50 (Break of HOD)
- **Exit**: 18706.50 (Break of HOD)
- **Result**: (-$100)

**Notes**: This was bouncing around R3 and looked like it was encountering heavy selling. Once it lost R3 I went short. Didn't get a very good entry. It was looking good for a while then popped up above R3 and I got stopped at break of the high of pre-market. I jumped the gun on this one again, but fortunately it was a very small position. I don't like NQ at all. I have never traded it well but this looked good. This was the first attempt with Cam points though.

### Trade 3: MNQ (Micro Nasdaq)
- **Position**: Short (2 contracts)
- **Entry**: 18,689.25 (After hard selling and retest of R3)
- **Original Stop**: 18,720.50 (Break of recent 5 minute high)
- **Exit-1**: 18,638.00 (Sold half at break of R2)
- **Exit-2**: 18,587.75 (Walked my stop loss down as a trail after break of R1)
- **Result**: (+$305.50)

**Notes**: The move that I was looking for during the pre-market. It had a nice pop up towards R4, but there was a lot of heavy selling pressure and looked like buyers were getting tired. Still a lot of wicks though and volume which made it a tricky trade. I was feeling regret going back into this one, but it was losing R3 and looking like it was turning over. My stop was pretty tight, and then it finally broke my way. Called it a day after this trade. I wanted more, but +410 is a good day for me.

### Summary
Ventured back into Nasdaq again. Almost regretted it but luckily the Cam points did their job. Was able to catch a nice trade in the evening session on Sunday night with oil and then had a trade attempt on NQ in the premarket that didn't work out. Looks like it was a little bit early, as eventually the trade did work out and I was able to short again after breakdown of R3. Had nice trade management as I moved my stop up to breakeven after it moved my way and then covered half at R2 and brought my stop down as a trail throughout the move down. Got stopped out eventually as it found support at the previous close. 

**Total P/L**: +$410.34
