### Overview
Kind of a weird day. Traded the evening session on Thursday night and struggled a bit, but woke up and caught a nice short overnight for a decent gain. Made one trade in the morning but was pretty burned out by then so I logged off and called it a day. I am in the home stretch and don't need much more for my combine to be completed. Just need a couple more decent days. 


### Trade Data

<div class="trade-table-container">
<div id="trade-table-placeholder">Loading trade data...</div>

<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    const tradeDate = "2024-06-21";  // Replace with the date of the trades you want to display
    const apiEndpoint = "https://x6vqzeow7a.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/get-trade-recaps";
    fetchTradeData(tradeDate, 'trade-table-placeholder', apiEndpoint);
  });
