Lately I have been dealing with overwhelming anxiety while trading. I think the biggest struggle that I seem to be having is not related to trading so much as it is coming from outside of trading. I'm going through a lot of different challenges in other areas of my life which makes it difficult to stay calm and calculated during the trading day. 

Not to mention that I am putting a lot of pressure on myself to pass this trading combine so that I am able to support my family. It makes every trade feel like life or death. It's causing me to watch every tick and to get super paranoid when the trade doesn't go my way. I'm making more decisions based on fear, which is causing me to take profits too soon, or move my stop loss further than I intended to initially. 

I don't really have any sort of clear methods for dealing with this, other than what other people have probably stated over and over. Take breaks. Breathe. Walk away from the screen. Those are all great, but in the moment it is really challenging to walk away from the screen. It's hard to focus on deep breaths. It's hard to stay cool and calm when you want to be successful at a really challenging pursuit.
