### Overview

Started the day off well with a nice little scalp on Micro Gold. Will continue to monitor throughout the day and see what is going. Took a trade on MES and got lucky on the pop back up. This one looks choppy, so I am glad I got out when I did. My silver trade was garbage though. Should not have taken it. It looks like it may go my way but I was way too overanxious and impatient with it. Just need to relax. 


**Total P/L**: +$255.79


### Trade 1: MCG (Micro GOLD)

- **Position**: Long (5 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2347.70 (Above S4)
- **Original Stop**: 2343.70 (Break of LOD)
- **Exit 1**: 2352.00 (Sold 3)
- **Exit 2**: 2356.70 (Sold 1 on pop towards VWAP)
- **Exit 3**: 2353.70 (Sold 1 on breakdown of 5 minute candle)


- **Result**: +$273.80

**Notes**: Woke up and saw this trading around the S4 level and was holding it pretty well. Was a little early on the entry, could have waiting for a bit more volume and confirmation, as it was looking like it might continue to sell off. However, as markets opened up around 7:30-9a we got buyers in and popped back up to VWAP and S3. Brought stop losses up to trail as it looked like it was going to retest the lows and S4 again.

### Trade 2: MES (Micro S&P)

- **Position**: Long (3 contracts)
- **Entry**: 5287.00 (Above S2 and VWAP)
- **Original Stop**: 5279.00 (Break of VWAP with buffer)
- **Exit 1**: 5295.75 (Sold 1 on massive spike)
- **Exit 2**: 5293.25 (Sold 1 on trailing stop)
- **Exit 3**: 5290.25(Trailing stopped out as it sold off back towards VWAP)


- **Result**: +$86.99

**Notes**: I didn't feel good about this after I entered. It looked like it was holding S3 pretty well and was wanting to go higher. I waited for a good entry but eventually got too impatient and jumped in. This one looked like it was going to stop me out. I think I came within a couple of ticks. However, there was a huge squeeze that I was able to sell into and now it is continuing to sell off back towards s3 and below. Glad I had the opportunity to get out when I had the chance to. Not sure what the pop was. Looks like 10am pop with a bunch of orders coming in. Should not have takent this trade! 


### Trade 3: SIL (Micro Silver)

</a>
- **Position**: Long (1 contract)
- **Entry**: 29.72 (Above Breadown Target after bounce)
- **Original Stop**: 29.62 (Break of the Breakdown Target (29.65))
- **Exit 1**: 29.61 (Stop Loss Triggered)

- **Result**: (-$105)

**Notes**: Should not have taken this trade. Feeling really down about it. Looks like it's going to go the way I wanted to, but I jumped in way too early and in a market I am unfamiliar with. It sold off pretty hard after my entry. It looks like it may bounce, but I jumped in way too early. Not good.




**Total P/L**: +$255.79
