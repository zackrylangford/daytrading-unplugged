### Overview
Up and down day for my account, but was able to close out with a nice gain for the day. Overtraded a bit and was letting myself get chopped around a bit. Had a couple of really nice trades, but also had some poor trades that were a bit overanxious. Trade management was decent, as I made sure to bring my stop losses up to break even as well as making sure to not be too greedy on my larger trades. Overall, it was stressful but I was able to make it out with a nice gain. 

*Trades that are in the PM were from Sunday evening trade session (6/30/2024)
