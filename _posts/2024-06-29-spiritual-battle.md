I don't want to get too deep here but I read something the other day that compared trading to something like a deep inner struggle that was somewhat spiritual in nature and it really hit home with me after the terrible week of trading that I had. 

The reason it hit home with me is because after about 6 years of trading I have constantly come to these points in my trading journey where I have to fight these incredibly challenging emotional and inner battles with myself over my trading habits. 

I have felt every emotion during trading. I have felt these emotions deeper than almost any other activity I have ever been involved in. Fear, greed, jealousy, anger, frustration, hope, joy, excitement, anxiety, depression, the list goes on and on. I have wept over how poorly I have handled my emotions during trading. I have given in to greed and ended up getting stung really hard for it. I have let fear control my trading decisions. 

Trading is something that challenges people to thier core. It is so much deeper than I think anyone realizes. It forces you to make decisions under the duress of these emotions and it forces you to reflect on your emotions and your feelings quickly and consistently. If you don't humbly learn to face your emotions then you will struggle and fail. 

This is a spiritual battle to me - the battle to deal with one's inner life. To overcome the deadly sins of greed, fear, jealousy, rage, and negative emotions by developing a humble and mature attitude is one of the best things that we can do for ourselves and those around us. 

I am learning this the hard way.
