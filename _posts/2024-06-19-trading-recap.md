### Overview
Since today is a holiday the futures markets are closed early. I didn't take huge risks because of the low volume and my trades were really quick in order to limit risk. Again, not a huge day in terms of profits but I know that once I begin to scale up it will be larger profits. The key right now is to book profits every day and work on my trade management. I feel like futures markets are definitely more conducive to quick trades, especially when trading from a TopStep account that requires closing positions at the end of the trading day every day. There really isn't much opportunity to hold for long moves. So many of the days that I have traded have had a lot of choppiness to them. Occasionally you will see longer trend type days where you can simply hold through the moves, but it makes more sense to do smaller trades, less risk, and take profits quicker. It's better to get lucky and catch a huge move while preparing to take profit and let it run for a bit with a trailing stop. 

Happy Juneteenth!
