### Overview
Just a really choppy day on ES. Took 4 trades today depending on the way it was going. Got stopped out on my initial long and was VERY fortunate that I only took a really small loss, as there was a huge spike of sellers that hit. Should have waiting until 10am as the sellers really came in and pushed it down quickly. I noticed this and switched my position and held for a breakdown towards VWAP. I covered half of my position around VWAP as it looked like buyers were going to squeeze the price back up at S4. I used a trailing stop to lock in slightly more gains but buyers were able to keep the price up. 

This same pattern played out all throughout the morning. The price was bouncing between S3 and S4 in big swings so it was difficult to find a good entry and also hold onto winners. I took really small positions again, even though I would have liked to take something bigger. I just didn't have the conviction that I needed in order to take a larger size. 

Either way, as tough as it is to take a really small green day, it is still a green day. The goal amount to pass the trading combine is $3000 profit so $30 is one percent closer and it gives me that much more of a cushion for next weeks trading. I locked myself out so I can go into the week with all 5 days of green. Not a huge week, but in terms of discipline I was able to handle it. Also, looking back at all of the catylysts and news (new all time high, cpi, fomc) I feel like I handled it pretty well. 

On to next week!
