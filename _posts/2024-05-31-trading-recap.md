### Trade Data

<div id="trade-table-placeholder">Loading trade data...</div>

<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    const tradeDate = "2024-05-31";  // Replace with the date of the trades you want to display
    const apiEndpoint = "https://x6vqzeow7a.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/get-trade-recaps";
    fetchTradeData(tradeDate, 'trade-table-placeholder', apiEndpoint);
  });
</script>
