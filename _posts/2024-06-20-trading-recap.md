### Overview
Super frustrating day today. MES looked like a clear short opportunity from the beggining but it kept holding on and bouncing which shook my confidence. Was able to catch a couple of decent moves to the downside but missed the really big sell off at noon. Either way, I took steps closer to my goal today, which is good. Just wish I would have hit the big move down :) 

As for how I was feeling, most of the time I was on edge and anxious. I was able to step away for a bit throughout the morning but I definitely felt like I overtraded a bit on this.
