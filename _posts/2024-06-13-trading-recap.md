### Overview
Waited till about 15 minutes after the open (9:44amish) to take the short position on MES. Again, only took a really small size as I am trying to limit my risk while learning. Turned out to be a really nice trade as the market sold off after failing to get above VWAP on the 5 minute, which was my entry. My exit was a new high of the day. Looked like S1 was going to hold and so I covered half of my position as it headed up higher for a really small gain and to limit more risk. Was able to bring stop loss down as it continued to sell and then selling really started to heat up so I trailed my second stop loss as new lows were made. Even though the PNL is small, if I would have taken even slightly larger position or simply held my entire position through the move it would have been a much more significant gain. The key for me though right now is managing risk and the easiest way to do that is to use way smaller position than I would like to and simply focus on getting really good trades. 

I also attempted to short again as it was consolidating below S2. It continued to break down so I was able to get a really tiny gain before buyers came back in and popped it up. Looks like it may continue lower, but I decided to lock myself out of my trading platform with a small gain. Have managed all green this week, even though it has been really small gains each day. I know that these are adding up and I am closer today than I was yesterday. If I can continue with small gains I will be funded eventually!
