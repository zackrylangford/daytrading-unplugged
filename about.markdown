Hi, I'm Zack! Since 2018, I've been captivated by the world of trading, exploring it both as a hobby and a side hustle. The markets have always intrigued me, and my interest in day trading and technical analysis has only grown over time.

For a while, the lack of substantial funds was a barrier to diving deeper into trading. However, discovering prop firms that offer trading combines and the opportunity to earn funded accounts was a game changer for me. This new path rekindled my passion and opened up new possibilities. My goal is to trade so that I can open up more free time to spend with my family and serve other people with my time. 

To pursue this dream, I opened a <a href="https://www.topstep.com" target="_blank">TopStep</a> account and began trading a combine. This blog is my personal diary, capturing every step of my journey toward becoming a funded trader with TopStep. Here, I share my experiences, insights, and the emotional roller coaster of trading, aiming to provide a transparent and human perspective on day trading.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure. I hope my journey inspires and informs fellow traders and anyone curious about the trading world.
